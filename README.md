This is the ultimate basic vim setup, based on [**JeffreyWay/.vimrc**](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834) and some inspiration from [**Amix/vimrc**](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

This is meant as a starting point, and contains the essentiels building blocks for a powerfull vim editor. If you are interested in more information check out the configuration section below.
