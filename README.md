# Ultimate .vimrc
This is **my personal version** of the ultimate basic vim setup, based on [**JeffreyWay/.vimrc**](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834) and some inspiration from [**Amix/vimrc**](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

This branch is based on the [ultimate-vimrc](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/ultimate-vimrc), that is meant as a general starting point for vim, and contains the essentiels building blocks for a powerfull vim editor.

This personal version of is modified to be perfect for my workflow, where I mostly work with html, javascript and php with Laravel.
