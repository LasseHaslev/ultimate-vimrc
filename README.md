# Ultimate .vimrc
This is **my personal version** of the ultimate basic vim setup, based on [**JeffreyWay/.vimrc**](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834) and some inspiration from [**Amix/vimrc**](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

This branch is based on the [ultimate-vimrc](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/ultimate-vimrc), that is meant as a general starting point for vim, and contains the essentiels building blocks for a powerfull vim editor.

This personal version of is modified to be perfect for my workflow, where I mostly work with html, javascript and php with Laravel.

**I really recomend checking out this serie [Vim Mastery](https://laracasts.com/series/vim-mastery) from [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) to get a full understanding of the power of vim text editor.**

##Install
I recomend using MacVim. Make sure you have the lastest version of [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) installed.

Then run the following line in your terminal

```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LasseHaslev/ultimate-vimrc/personal/install.sh)"```

**Restart vim and you are good to go!**
